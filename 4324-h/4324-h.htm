PREFACE
</H3>

<P>
The fifty fables in this book have been selected for second grade
reading because they are easily comprehended by pupils of that grade,
and because they teach lessons which every child should learn.
</P>

<P>
It is not wise to tell the class the moral application of the fables.
It is better to have each pupil make his own application without any
suggestion from the teacher.
</P>

<P>
In adapting the stories the conversational form has been largely used;
this form not only gives much pleasure to the children, but it also
affords excellent opportunities for voice culture.
</P>

<P>
Most of the stories have been successfully used for several years with
classes of children in the State Normal School at DeKalb.

THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS
</H3>

<P>
"Take me with you, please," called a tortoise to a gray duck and a
white duck that were flying over.
</P>

<P>
The ducks heard the tortoise and flew down toward him.
</P>

<P>
"Do you really wish to go with us?" asked the ducks as they came to the
ground near the tortoise.
</P>

<P>
"I surely do," replied the tortoise. "Will you please take me?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes, I think we can do so," said the white duck slowly.
</P>

<P>
The two ducks talked together in low tones for a few minutes. Then they
flew to the woods. They soon brought back a strong twig and dropped it
in front of the tortoise.
</P>

<P>
"Now," said the ducks, "if we take you off to see the world, you must
promise us one thing."
</P>

<P>
"What is that?" asked the tortoise. "I will promise almost anything if
you will let me go."
</P>

<P>
"You must promise not to say one word while you are in the air, NOT ONE
WORD," replied the ducks.
</P>

<P>
"All right, I promise," said the tortoise. "Sometimes I do not say a
word for a whole day because there is no one to listen to me."
</P>

<P>
"Well, take firm hold of the middle of the twig; we are ready to
start," said the gray duck.
</P>

<P>
"If you value your life, you must hold on tightly," said the white duck.
</P>

<P>
The tortoise took hold of the middle of the twig and each duck took
hold of one end.
</P>

<P>
Then they flew up! up! up! while the tortoise swung from the middle of
the twig. How he enjoyed it! He had never had such a ride.
</P>

<P>
They had gone a long way safely when they came to a hayfield. The
haymakers looked up and saw the ducks and the tortoise.
</P>

<P>
"Ho! ho! the tortoise has stolen some wings," called one of the
haymakers.
</P>

<P>
"What a queer carriage he has!" laughed another in a loud voice.
</P>

<P>
"I pity his horses," said another.
</P>

<P>
This made the tortoise so angry that he cried out, "You&mdash;" but no one
knows what he was going to say, for he fell to the ground and was
killed.

THE MOUSE AND THE FROG
</H3>

<P>
A frog, while out walking one day, saw a mouse coming toward him.
</P>

<P>
"There is that foolish mouse," said he. "I will play a good joke on
him," and he grinned as he thought how much fun he would have.
</P>

<P>
As they met, the frog said, "Good morning, Sir Mouse; I hope I find you
well to-day."
</P>

<P>
"Very well," replied the mouse. "How are you?"
</P>

<P>
"My health is not very good, so I have taken a holiday. If you are not
busy, what do you say to our spending the day together?"
</P>

<P>
"Good!" answered the mouse. "I have little to do and nothing would suit
me better." So they started off together.
</P>

<P>
They had not gone far when the frog said, "Let me tie one of your front
feet to one of my hind legs, so that I may not lose you."
</P>

<P>
"All right," replied the mouse. "We shall surely be fast friends then."
</P>

<P>
So the frog took a blade of grass and fastened one of the mouse's front
feet to one of his hind legs. When the frog leaped, the mouse tumbled
after. Then they stopped and had a big laugh; it was very funny.
</P>

<P>
They first went to an oat field, where the frog found many insects, and
the mouse plenty of grain.
</P>

<P>
Beyond this field there was a pond. The frog had been going toward this
pond all of the time, but the mouse had not noticed it. They were soon
on its bank.
</P>

<P>
When the mouse saw the pond he cried out, "Oh, you know I do not like
the water, Mr. Frog. Let us go to the barn."
</P>

<P>
"Nothing would do you so much good as a cool bath on this hot day. You
have never taken one, so you can not know how good it will make you
feel," and the frog jumped into the water.
</P>

<P>
The mouse tried to get free, but the frog only laughed.
</P>

<P>
A hawk, looking down, saw the mouse and swooped down upon it. Since the
frog was fastened to the mouse, he too was carried off, and both lost
their lives.
</P>

<P>
When the other frogs heard of what had happened, they said, "Served him
right. Served him right," and no frog since that time has ever played a
mean joke.

THE BOYS AND THE FROGS
</H3>

<P>
"Let us go to the pond and have some fun," said George.
</P>

<P>
"What fun can we have there?" asked Frank. "The pond is nothing but an
old mudhole. We can not swim in such water."
</P>

<P>
Down at the pond the sun shone warm, and an old mother frog and her
children were sunning themselves on a log. Now and then one plunged
into the water with a chug! and then crawled out on the bank.
</P>

<P>
That was a happy time in frog land.
</P>

<P>
In the midst of their play, they heard a sound which made the mother
frog tremble. It was only a boy's laugh, but as soon as the mother
heard it she said, "Into the water, every one of you. The giants are
coming;" and they all jumped into the water.
</P>

<P>
The giants had armed themselves with pebbles. Each one had a pocketful.
As soon as they caught sight of the frogs, they cried, "Now for some
fun!"
</P>

<P>
Before the mother frog could reach the water, a stone hit her on one of
her feet. The one-sided battle had begun.
</P>

<P>
Every time a little frog peeped out of the water to get a breath of air
or to look at the two giants, whiz! flew a pebble right toward it, and
it never cared to look at its enemies again.
</P>

<P>
The mother became very angry. She lifted her head boldly above the
water.
</P>

<P>
"Cowards!" she cried. "If we could sting, would you fight us? If we
could bite, would you be here? You have great sport tormenting us,
because we cannot fight for ourselves. You are cowards! cowards!"
</P>

<P>
And all the little frogs echoed, "Cowards! cowards!"
</P>

THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE WOLF
</H3>

<P>
John was a shepherd boy. He cared for his father's sheep. As there were
many wolves prowling about waiting for a chance to kill the sheep, John
had to be very watchful.
</P>

<P>
Some men were harvesting wheat in a field not far from where the flock
was feeding. One day they were startled by the cry, "A wolf! a wolf!"
They looked up and saw John motioning wildly to them and pointing
toward the sheep.
</P>

<P>
They threw down their sickles and ran to the flock. But they found the
sheep quietly grazing, and there was no wolf to be seen.
</P>

<P>
"Where is the wolf?" they asked.
</P>

<P>
"I didn't say the wolf was here,' replied John, and he laughed loud and
long as he saw the look of surprise in the men's faces.
</P>

<P>
"What do you mean, you young rascal, by fooling us so?" they cried.
</P>

<P>
If they could have caught John, they would have given him a sound
whipping, but he had run out of their reach.
</P>

<P>
Not many days after, these same men heard the cry, "Wolf! wolf!"
</P>

<P>
"John is trying to fool us again," they said, and went on with their
work.
</P>

<P>
John called again and again, and seemed in so much trouble that the
kind-hearted men left their work and hurried toward the sheep pasture.
</P>

<P>
When they came to the pasture, they knew that John had been playing
another trick on them. They looked for him, but could not find him. He
had hidden in some bushes where he could look on and enjoy their
surprise and anger. At last they went back to their work.
</P>

<P>
One day wolves did come. John was very much frightened. He ran to the
men for help. They only laughed at him. "Oh, you have fooled us twice,"
they said. "You shall not have another chance."
</P>

<P>
"But the wolves are surely there," cried John. "They are killing the
sheep. Do come and help!" The men kept on with their work and did not
even look at John.
</P>

<P>
Before he could find anyone who would believe him, many of the sheep
had been killed.

THE TWO GOATS
</H3>

<P>
A small stream ran between two hills. Over this stream there was a very
narrow bridge. If two persons came to the opposite ends of this bridge
at the same time, one must wait for the other to cross before he could
go over.
</P>

<P>
One morning, two goats, a black one and a white one, reached the
opposite ends of the bridge at the same moment.
</P>

<P>
The black goat called out to the white one, "Hold on a minute; I am
coming over."
</P>

<P>
The white goat replied, "No, I will go over first; I am in a hurry."
</P>

<P>
"No," said the black goat, "I will not wait for you. I am the older."
</P>

<P>
"You shall wait for me," roared the white goat as he stepped upon the
bridge and started across.
</P>

<P>
"We'll see if I am to wait for you," said the black goat, and he too
started across.
</P>

<P>
They met in the middle of the bridge.
</P>

<P>
"Go back and let me cross,' said the white goat, stamping his foot.
</P>

<P>
"Go back, yourself," replied the black goat, and he pushed against the
other.
</P>

<P>
They were very angry. Each drew back. Their heads came together with
terrible force. They locked horns. The white goat lost his footing and
fell, pulling the black goat over with him, and both were drowned.

THE STRIKE OF THE MILL FEEDERS
</H3>

<P>
The mill feeders of a great mill&mdash;the stomach&mdash;met together to talk
over their trials.
</P>

<P>
The hands said, "We are tired of carrying grist to the door of the
greedy mill. We would rather spend all our time painting pictures or
writing books."
</P>

<P>
"We were made for talking and singing," said the lips, "but much of our
time has to be spent in taking grist for the mill."
</P>

<P>
"And we," said the teeth, "give our life to crushing the grist which is
brought to the mill. We are wearing out in its service, but what thanks
do we get?"
</P>

<P>
"I have never had a holiday," said the tongue. "I do not mind talking,
but I do not like to work for the mill. Three times a day or oftener, I
must help the teeth to prepare the grist. I am tired of it."
</P>

<P>
The gullet said, "My whole life is given up to carrying the grist to
the mill. I do not like such work. Let the mill feed itself. It has no
business to work us to death."
</P>

<P>
"Let us all stop work," cried the mill feeders. "We will stop at once;"
and so the mill shut down.
</P>

<P>
Many hours after, the lips said, "How strange that we should not feel
like talking now that we have nothing else to do!"
</P>

<P>
The hands said, "We are too weak to paint or to write. We never felt so
tired before."
</P>

<P>
The tongue became parched and all the mill feeders were unhappy.
</P>

<P>
More hours passed; then the mill feeders held another meeting. It was a
short, quiet, earnest meeting.
</P>

<P>
"We have been fools," they all said. "The mill was working for us while
we were working for it. Our strength came from the grist which we sent
to it. We can do nothing without the help of the mill. Let us go to
work again. If the mill will only grind for us, we will gladly furnish
the grist."

THE FARMER AND HIS SONS
</H3>

<P>
"Boys, why are you always quarreling? That is no way to live," said a
farmer to his sons one day.
</P>

<P>
The sons would not listen to their father. Each wanted the best of
everything. Each thought the father did more for the others than for
him.
</P>

<P>
The father bore the quarreling as long as he could. One day he called
his seven sons to him. He had in his hand a bundle of seven sticks.
</P>

<P>
"I wish to see which one of you can break this bundle of sticks," he
said.
</P>

<P>
The oldest one tried first. He was the strongest, but he could not
break it though he used all his strength. Then each of his brothers
tried hard to break the bundle. None of them could break it.
</P>

<P>
At last they gave the bundle of sticks back to their father, saying,
"We cannot break it."
</P>

<P>
The father untied the bundle and gave each son one stick.
</P>

<P>
"Now see if you can break the sticks," said their father.
</P>

<P>
They all said, "That is very easily done," and they held up the broken
sticks.
</P>

<P>
"Now tell us why you asked us to break these sticks," said the sons.
</P>

<P>
"Do you not see," replied the father, "that if you all stand together,
nothing can harm you; but if each of you stands by himself, you may
easily be ruined?"

"Those oxen are too good friends to suit me," said a hungry lion. "They
are never far apart, and when I am near them they turn their tails to
one another and show long sharp horns on every side. They even walk
down to the river together when they become thirsty. If I could catch
one of them by himself, I should have a feast."
</P>

<P>
But one day the oxen had a quarrel.
</P>

<P>
"The grass is freshest over in the valley," said one of them. "Let us
go there."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I don't like the grass there," said another. "It is better on the
side of the hill. Let us spend the day there."
</P>

<P>
"I do not want to climb the hill," said the third ox. "The grass right
here suits me best."
</P>

<P>
"I do not like any of the places of which you speak," said the fourth
ox. "Come with me and I will find you the best grass you ever tasted."
</P>

<P>
"I am going to the valley," said the first ox. "You three may go where
you please."
</P>

<P>
"And I shall go to the hill," said the second ox. "I think you are mean
not to go with me."
</P>

<P>
"And I," said the third ox, "shall stay right here. You may all be
sorry if you leave me. The lion may catch you."
</P>

<P>
"I am not afraid of the lion," said the fourth ox; "and if none of you
will go with me, I shall go by myself to hunt a better pasture than any
of you can find. I am older than you and I know where the best grass
grows. You had better follow me."
</P>

<P>
"We will not do it," said the other three oxen. "You are not our leader
if you are older."
</P>

<P>
So the four oxen separated. One went to the valley. The lion was down
by the river and saw him coming. He waited quietly until the ox was
very near; then he pounced upon him and killed him.
</P>

<P>
Then the lion looked about for the other oxen. One of them was feeding
on the hill. He saw the lion coining, but, he could not get away. He
could not defend himself with only one pair of horns; so he too was
killed.
</P>

<P>
As the other two oxen were far apart, it was an easy matter for the
lion to kill them also. And that is the way the quarrel ended.

THE HUNTER AND THE FARMER
</H3>

<P>
"Are you afraid of a lion? I am not. There is nothing that I should
like better than to meet one," said a man to his neighbor whose calf
the lion had killed. "To-morrow morning I will go out and hunt for this
fierce lion, which is doing so much harm. If he is anywhere about, I
shall find him and kill him, and thus rid the village of fear."
</P>

<P>
The next morning the man started out alone to hunt the lion. He had, a
gun and a sword. He looked so brave as he started off that the people
in the village said, "What a blessing it is to have so fearless a man
in our village! He will keep us from harm."
</P>

<P>
He walked several miles. At last he came near a jungle. He thought that
the lion might have his home there. He asked a farmer whom he met if he
had seen the tracks of a lion.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," said the farmer, "and I will show you where you can find him."
</P>

<P>
When the man heard this, he turned pale and trembled with fright.
</P>

<P>
"I do not care to see the lion," he cried. "I only wanted to see his
tracks."
</P>

<P>
The farmer turned away in disgust, saying, "It is easy to be brave when
you are out of danger."

THE FOX IN THE WELL
</H3>

<P>
Once upon a time a fox fell into a well. He was not hurt by his fall.
As there was little water in the well, he was in no danger of drowning;
but he could not get out.
</P>

<P>
He cried, "Help! help! help! help!" but no one heard him.
</P>

<P>
By and by a wolf passed by the well. He heard the call. He looked into
the well and asked, "Who is down there?"
</P>

<P>
"It is I," cried the fox. "I am glad that you have come to help me out."
</P>

<P>
"How did you get down there?" asked the wolf. "Have you been there
long? Is the water very deep? Poor fellow, I do pity you! That is no
place for you. You have a very bad cold, I see. I wish you were out."
</P>

<P>
"Please don't talk to me," cried the fox. "It is help I need. Do get me
out and then I shall know that you are sorry for me."

THE MICE IN COUNCIL
</H3>

<P>
What a queer meeting that was down in the cellar! There were big mice,
little mice, old mice, young mice, gray mice, and brown mice, all very
sober and thoughtful.
</P>

<P>
At last an old mouse spoke up and said, "Shall we have Mr. Graypate for
our chairman? All those who wish Mr. Graypate to be chairman will
please hold up their right hands." Every mouse raised a tiny paw.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Graypate walked out to the front and took charge of the meeting. It
was well that they chose him, for he was the wisest mouse in the whole
country. Gazing over the crowd, he said, "Will Mr. Longtail tell us why
we have met here? Mr. Longtail, come out in front where we can hear
you."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Longtail walked slowly to the front. Then he stood upon his hind
legs and said:
</P>

<P>
"My friends, I think you all know why we are here. Last night Mrs.
Whitenose, whom we all love, and all her family were killed by the big
white cat. The night before, while Mrs. Blackfoot was out hunting, all
her cunning little babies were killed by the same cat. Early this week
one of my finest boys was killed. You or I may be next.
</P>

<P>
"Must we bear this and do nothing at all to save our loved ones and
ourselves? We have met here to make some plan for our defense."
</P>

<P>
Having spoken, Mr. Longtail walked back into the crowd.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Graypate arose and said:
</P>

<P>
"You have heard why we are here. Anyone who has a good plan for ridding
us of the cat will please tell of it. The meeting is open to all."
</P>

<P>
"Let us all run at him suddenly when he is not looking for us, and each
give him a bite. That would surely kill him," said one brave mouse.
</P>

<P>
"But how many of us do you think he would kill?" said another mouse. "I
will not risk my life nor that of my family." "Nor I"; "nor I"; "nor
I," said many other mice.
</P>

<P>
"Let us steal his food and starve him to death," suggested another.
</P>

<P>
"That will only make him hungrier for mice," they replied. "That will
never do."
</P>

<P>
"I wish we might drown him," said another; "but I don't know how we
could get him into the water."
</P>

<P>
At last a little gray mouse with a squeaky voice went up to the front
and spoke:
</P>

<P>
"I have a plan that will surely work. If we could know when the cat is
coming, we could get out of his way. He steals in upon us so quietly,
that we can not escape. Let us find a little bell and a string. Let us
put the bell on the string and tie the string around the cat's neck. As
soon as we hear the bell, we can run and get out of the cat's way."
</P>

<P>
"A very good plan," said Mr. Longtail. "We will ask our leader to say
which mouse shall put the bell on the cat's neck."
</P>

<P>
At this there was a great outcry. One said, "I am so little that I can
not reach high enough to bell the cat." Another said, "I have been very
sick and am too weak to lift the bell"; and so the excuses came pouring
in.
</P>

<P>
At last Mr. Graypate called to the crowd, "Silence! I shall choose no
one. Who will offer to bell the cat?"
</P>

<P>
It was very quiet in the meeting. One after another of the younger mice
went out. None but the older ones were left. At last they too went
sadly home. No one would bell the cat.

THE FOX AND THE CROW
</H3>

<P>
One day the door of a cottage stood open. A tame crow flew through the
door into the cottage. She stole a piece of meat from the table, and
flew to a branch of a tall tree.
</P>

<P>
Just as she had settled there to enjoy her meat a fox came along and
stopped under the tree. He sniffed something good to eat. Looking
about, he saw the meat in the crow's mouth and wanted it.
</P>

<P>
How could he get the meat? He could not climb the tree. What good would
it do if he could? The crow would fly away when she saw him coming. He
could not coax the crow to come down to the ground. She knew what a fox
likes to eat.
</P>

<P>
At last the fox had a happy thought. He said to himself, "A crow is one
of the proudest birds I ever knew. I will flatter her and she will
forget about the meat."
</P>

<P>
So he called out in his sweetest voice, "Good day, my pretty bird"; but
the crow did not reply. She only stepped about proudly on the branch.
</P>

<P>
"I wish I had such a beautiful form as you have," said the fox.
</P>

<P>
Still no answer, but the crow held up her head and turned it first to
one side and then to the other, showing that she was pleased.
</P>

<P>
"What a graceful neck and bright eye!" said the fox. "The other birds
may well be jealous of you."
</P>

<P>
No answer yet. She only raised her wings a little and gazed down upon
the fox.
</P>

<P>
"If your voice were only as beautiful as your form and your dress, you
would be queen of all the birds; but it seems that you can not talk at
all. What a pity that you are dumb!"
</P>

<P>
The crow gave a loud "caw!" As she did so, the meat fell from her
mouth. The fox snapped it up quickly.
</P>

<P>
Poor crow, she saw when too late that the fox was only fooling her.

THE VAIN CROW
</H3>

<P>
"I hate a black dress, no matter how glossy," said a proud crow. "I
have made up my mind to be a peacock."
</P>

<P>
As he said this, he flew away to a barnyard where he found some
feathers which the peacock had shed. He picked these up with his bill
and placed them among his own feathers.
</P>

<P>
Then he marched back and forth, looking at his fine new coat. He even
tried to walk like the peacock.
</P>

<P>
The peafowls came into the yard. They did not know at first what to
make of the sight. Then they saw that the crow was trying to dress and
act as they did. They flew at him, calling, "Away with the cheat! Away
with the cheat!" They pulled out all the peacock feathers and many of
his own glossy black ones.
</P>

<P>
He was glad to get away alive, and flew back to his own family and old
friends. But one of the crows had seen him in the barnyard and told the
others how silly he had been acting.
</P>

<P>
"Where have you been?" they cried. "We know. We know. We will not have
you in this flock. Away! away!" And they drove him from them.
</P>

<P>
Even the owls, whom he had always hated, made eyes at him and screamed,
"Ch-ea-t! ch-ea-t!"
</P>

<P>
He flew into the forest. Here in a tree by a pond he lived a lonely
life.
</P>

<P>
The tree-toads learned their queer song from him. This is his warning
to them. "Don't, don't-be-cheat! Don't, don't-be-cheat!"

THE HORSE AND THE LOADED DONKEY
</H3>

<P>
A man once owned a beautiful black horse and a very ugly donkey.
</P>

<P>
The horse always had plenty to eat and was well groomed, but the donkey
was very poorly cared for.
</P>

<P>
One bright morning both animals were made ready for a long journey. A
saddle was placed upon the horse, and a heavy pack of goods was loaded
upon the donkey.
</P>

<P>
The donkey was a very patient animal. When well, he never complained of
his hard lot, but this morning he staggered under the weight of his
load. After going a short distance, he looked up at the proud horse and
asked:
</P>

<P>
"Would you mind helping me to-day? I feel too ill to carry this heavy
load. If you will help me, I shall soon be well and able to carry the
whole load. If you refuse to help me, I shall surely fall by the way;
then you will have to bear the burden alone."
</P>

<P>
The horse held his head very high while the donkey was talking; then he
replied:
</P>

<P>
"Go on, you lazy beast! I am not a burden bearer. No, I will not take
one ounce of your load."
</P>

<P>
The donkey groaned and moved forward a few steps, then fell to the
ground dead.
</P>

<P>
The load was taken from the dead donkey's back and placed upon the
horse.
</P>

<P>
At the close of the day the horse reached the end of his journey. Every
bone in his body was aching, and he was so lame that he could hardly
walk.

"What you say is all very true, but you should not forget us," said a

THE FARMER AND HIS THREE SONS
</H3>

<P>
A farmer who had worked hard all his life was taken sick. He knew that
he must soon die. He called his three sons about his bed to give them
some advice.
</P>

<P>
"My sons," said he, "keep all of the land which I leave you. Do not
sell any of it, for there is a treasure in the soil. I shall not tell
you where to hunt for it, but if you try hard to find it, and do not
give up, you will surely succeed.
</P>

<P>
"As soon as the harvest is over, begin your search with plow, and
spade, and rake. Turn every foot of earth, then turn it again and
again. The treasure is there."
</P>

<P>
After the father died, the sons gathered in the harvest. As soon as the
grain had been cared for, they planned to search for the hidden
treasure. The farm was divided into three equal parts. Each son agreed
to dig carefully his part.
</P>

<P>
Every foot of soil was turned by the plow or by the spade. It was next
harrowed and raked, but no treasure was found. That seemed very strange.
</P>

<P>
"Father was an honest man and a wise man," said the youngest son. "He
would never have told us to hunt for the treasure if it were not here.
Do you not remember that he said, 'Turn the soil again and again'? He
surely thought the treasure worth hunting for."
</P>

<P>
"Our land is in such good condition now that we might as well sow
winter wheat," said the oldest son. His brothers agreed to this and the
wheat was sown.
</P>

<P>
The next harvest was so great that it surprised them. No neighbor's
field bore so many bushels of wheat to the acre. The sons were pleased
with their success.
</P>

<P>
After the wheat was harvested, they met to make plans for searching
again for the hidden treasure. The second son said:
</P>

<P>
"I have been thinking ever since our big harvest that perhaps father
knew how this search would turn out. We have much gold, We did not find
it in a hole in the ground, but we found it by digging. If we had not
cultivated our fields well, we should not have had such a crop of
wheat. Our father was wise; we have dug for the treasure and have found
it.
</P>

<P>
"We will cultivate the ground still better next year and make the soil
rich; then we shall find more treasure."
</P>

<P>
The other sons agreed to this. "It is good to work for what we get,"
they said.
</P>

<P>
Year after year the farm was well tilled and bore good crops. The sons
became rich, and they had two things much better than wealth&mdash;good
health and happiness.

THE YOUNG FOX

<P>
"You may hunt with me now, Reynard," said a wise old fox to his young
son. "It is time that you were beginning to make your living."
</P>

<P>
"That pleases me well," said Reynard. "I should not mind going out
alone."
</P>

<P>
"You are not ready yet to go by yourself. There are many things that I
must teach you first. Do not go without me."
</P>

<P>
Reynard said nothing, but the next day, when his father was asleep, he
went out into the field and brought home a nice, fat partridge.
</P>

<P>
He wakened his father by a quick bark and said, "See what I have
caught. I do not need to go with you."
</P>

<P>
"You do not know what you need," replied his father. "No wise fox hunts
in the daytime."
</P>

<P>
But Reynard did not mind what his father said, and every day he went
out hunting. He killed so many chickens, turkeys and ducks that
everyone tried to catch him.
</P>

<P>
One night the old fox started out alone, but Reynard crept slowly after
him. The old fox went toward a large farmhouse. He stopped suddenly in
the path and waited; then he ran on quickly.
</P>

<P>
Reynard followed. He stopped at the same place where the old fox had
stopped.
</P>

<P>
"What is this?" he said. "A fine white turkey down in the grass! Well,
well, is my father losing his sharp sight and his keen scent? I shall
not let such a prize get away from me!"

He sprang upon the turkey. The trap gave a loud snap, and Reynard was a
prisoner.

VISIT OF THE MOUSE TO THE COUNTRY

<P>
"Mother, may I go into the country to-day? You said I might go some
day. I am big enough now to go out alone. Do let me go," said Frisky, a
young mouse, to his mother.
</P>

<P>
"Well, child, I can not be with you always. I suppose there must be a
first time for you to go out alone. I dread to have you go, but if you
will promise to run home if a cat comes near you, I will let you go,"
said Mrs. Gray, the mother.
</P>

<P>
"I will run, mother, if I see a cat. You know how fast I can go. I
should like to see any cat catch me. I shall not be gone long. Good-by,
mother," and off went Frisky.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Gray watched him until he was out of sight. "I wish I had gone
with him," she said. "He does not know the world as I do. I fear some
harm will come to him," and she looked very much worried as she turned
to go into her house. She tried to sleep, for she was very tired; but
when she dozed she dreamed, and her dreams were all bad ones.
</P>

<P>
At last she went back to the door and looked for Frisky. He was coming,
leaping along in a great hurry. He began talking to his mother before
he reached her.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, mother," he said, "I met two big creatures on the other side of
the pasture.
</P>

<P>
"One of them was very fine looking. She had very gentle ways. She
stepped about so quietly that one could scarcely hear her. Her dress
was of soft gray fur, much like yours, mother, and she wore whiskers
like yours. I knew you would like to see her, so I was just going to
invite her home with me when a terrible-looking creature came right
toward me.
</P>

<P>
"He walked as if he were too good to step on the ground. His legs were
naked, his toes were long, and his toe nails were strong and sharp. His
dress was not so soft as yours. It was black and white. His mouth
looked like a trap. I tell you, mother, I should hate to get caught in
that trap. On top of his head was something that wobbled as he walked.
He straightened himself up, raised his arms and screamed. Such a
scream! It nearly frightened me to death. He isn't coming, is he,
mother? Do let me run into the house."
</P>

<P>
"My son," said his mother, stopping Frisky as he tried to pass her, "I
shall not let you go out alone again until you know more.
</P>

<P>
"That animal which you liked so well and wished to invite to our house
is a cat. It is the very one no doubt that killed all of your brothers
and sisters when they were quite small. She would have killed you too
at the same time if a dog had not come along and frightened her away.
If you had gone close to her this afternoon, I should never have seen
you again. I thought you would know a cat.
</P>

<P>
"The creature of which you were afraid cares nothing for us. He would
not have harmed you. He has bare legs so he can wade about in the grass
and not get his clothing wet. He uses those long toes and sharp claws
to scratch in the earth for food. He does not catch mice with them. He
uses that strong bill for picking up grain. People call him a rooster."

THE TWO DOVES
</H3>

<P>
Two doves, White-coat and Blue-feather, lived in a dovecote. They were
brothers and were very fond of each other. White-coat was a great home
body, but Blue-feather liked to travel.
</P>

<P>
One day Blue-feather said to White-coat, "I want to see the world. This
place is very tame. I have lived here all my life (he was only six
months old) and have seen all there is to see. I want to visit other
countries."
</P>

<P>
"Don't go, Blue-feather," said White-coat. "We have all we want to eat
here, everyone is kind, and we have a good home. I have heard that in
other places men set traps for birds or shoot them, and that sometimes
large hawks swoop down and carry them off. You might be caught out in a
storm and find no shelter; besides, it would almost kill me to be
separated from you long. You might be able to bear it, but not I.
Surely it is best to stay at home."
</P>

<P>
Just then a crow cawed. "Do you hear that crow, brother?" asked
White-coat. "It seems to say, 'You will be sorry if you go.' Do not go.
Take his warning. See, too, it is raining. If you must go, do put it
off until a better time."
</P>

<P>
"White-coat, why do you make such a fuss about nothing? I shall not be
gone more than three days; then you shall hear of all the wonderful
things I saw. I shall tell what happened to me from the beginning of my
journey until its close. It will be almost as good as going yourself."
</P>

<P>
"I do not care about the world," said White-coat. "How can I let you
go! You will find me watching for you at whatever time of day or night
you reach home. I can not eat, I can not sleep, with you away."
</P>

<P>
At this, they said a sad good-by to each other, and Blue-feather flew
away.
</P>

<P>
A dark cloud covered the sky. Blue-feather looked about for shelter. He
flew to the only tree near, but its leaves could not keep off the
driving rain, so his coat was wet through and through.
</P>

<P>
When the sky was clear again, Blue-feather left the tree and dried his
plumage as he flew.
</P>

<P>
On the borders of a wood he spied some scattered grains of wheat. He
was hungry and saw no reason why he should not pick them up. As he flew
down, a snare was drawn about him. The wheat had been put there to
tempt pigeons so that they might get caught. It was well for
Blue-feather that the snare had been in use a long time and was rotten.
By using his beak and wings he got loose, but he lost a few feathers
out of his pretty coat.
</P>

<P>
A hawk saw him as he rose. Blue-feather was dragging a piece of the
string which he could not loosen from his leg. The hawk was about to
seize him. It seemed as if there was no help for him. But just at that
moment an eagle caught the hawk and carried him off.
</P>

<P>
Blue-feather flew as fast as he could to a high fence, where he stopped
to rest. He thought his dangers were over. He was very homesick.
</P>

<P>
While Blue-feather was sitting on the fence, a boy saw him. He nearly
killed the poor bird with a shot from his sling.
</P>

<P>
Blue-feather was just able to fly. His leg was lame, and one wing was
hurt, but he steered straight for home.
</P>

<P>
Late at night he arrived at his own dovecote, tired and hungry, but
happy to be safe at home again. He found White-coat waiting for him.
</P>

<P>
White-coat smoothed his poor brother's feathers, nestled close to him,
and soothed him with his coo! coo! coo!

THE HORSE AND THE WOLF
</H3>

<P>
A horse, in the early spring, was turned into a pasture of fresh grass.
He was enjoying himself very much when a hungry wolf spied him. The
horse did not see the wolf.
</P>

<P>
The wolf said, "I want that horse. I have not had a good meal for a
month. He is so big that I can not catch him as I would a sheep. I
shall have to play a trick." So he lay down on the ground and thought
how he could deceive the horse and then catch him.
</P>

<P>
"I have it," he said at last. "I will be a doctor. The horse is sound
and well, but I will make him think that he needs a doctor; then I
shall tell him that I can cure him." The wolf smacked his lips as he
thought of the meal he would soon have.
</P>

<P>
He marched into the pasture in a very business-like way. Going right up
to the horse, he said:
</P>

<P>
"Good morning, my dear sir. This is fine grass you are eating and a
beautiful morning to be out. I am sorry to see you looking so poorly
this bright day. I happen to be a doctor. As you know, a good doctor
can tell at sight when one is sick. If you were well, you would not
have been turned out to pasture. You know that there is much work to be
done at this time of the year. Your master must think that you are not
able to work.
</P>

<P>
"Now, my friend, be frank with me; tell me what ails you, that I may
cure you. I have been to the best schools in the country. There I
learned about diseases of every kind and a sure cure for every disease.
If you have no money to pay my bill, do not let that trouble you. We
can settle that later."
</P>

<P>
The horse looked at the wolf out of the corner of his eye and said,
"Now that I think of it, I believe that something is wrong with the
bottom of my left hind foot."
</P>

<P>
All the time the wolf had been looking for a good chance to spring upon
the horse, but the horse did not let him get out of his sight for an
instant.
</P>

<P>
When the horse told of his trouble the wolf replied, "Yes, I understand
just what is the matter. There are many others having that same trouble
this year. I have had as many as twenty cases. All are doing well. Let
me look at your foot. Raise it now, please, care&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
At this instant the horse raised his foot, and with it gave the wolf
such a terrible kick in his face that he fell heavily to the ground.
The horse went on feeding.
</P>

<P>
As soon as the wolf was able to get up, he went groaning out of the
field. He was cured of one thing, but the medicine was very bitter.

THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT
</H3>

<P>
There was once a terrible war between the birds and the beasts. For a
long time it was doubtful which would win.
</P>

<P>
The bat said, "I am not a bird and I am not a beast, so I shall fight
on neither side."
</P>

<P>
At last the beasts seemed to be gaining the victory. The bat flew to
them and said, "I am a beast. Look at my body and you will see that I
am. I shall fight on your side."
</P>

<P>
New flocks of birds came to help their relatives, and the battle soon
turned against the beasts.
</P>

<P>
Then the bat skulked over to the other side. "I am a bird," said he. "I
can prove it by my wings," and he fought with the birds.
</P>

<P>
At last the war was over. The bat was hated by beasts and birds. Both
made war upon him. He was obliged to slink off and hide in dark places
during the day, never showing his face until dusk.

THE BEES, THE DRONES, AND THE WASP

<P>
Some working bees had made their comb in the hollow trunk of an oak.
</P>

<P>
The drones said, "We made that comb. It belongs to us."
</P>

<P>
"You did not make that comb," replied the workers. "You know very well
that you did not. We made it."
</P>

<P>
The drones answered, "That comb belongs to us and we are going to have
it."
</P>

<P>
So the workers took the case to Judge Wasp that he might decide the
matter.
</P>

<P>
The workers and the drones settled down before him. "You workers and
drones," said he, "are so much alike in shape and color that it is hard
to tell which has been seen in the tree. But I think the matter can be
justly decided. Each party may go to a hive in which there is no honey,
and build up a new comb. The one that makes comb and honey like that
found in the tree is the owner of the tree comb."
</P>

<P>
"All right," said the workers, "we will do it;" but the drones said,
"We will have nothing to do with such a plan."
</P>

<P>
So Judge Wasp said, "It is plain to see which of you made the comb. It
belongs to the workers."
</P>

<P>
The drones buzzed away very angry, but they were not able to harm the
workers or the judge, and the workers went back to their tree.

THE WOODMAN AND HIS AX
</H3>

<P>
One day a poor woodman lost his ax. He hunted all day, but he could not
find it. He was very sad, for how could he make a living for his family
without an ax? Besides he had no money with which to buy a new one. As
night came on, he sank down by the roadside and buried his face in his
hands.
</P>

<P>
He heard a noise in the bushes and raised his head. A stranger was
standing by him. "What is the matter?" asked the stranger. The woodman
told him of his trouble.
</P>

<P>
"I am sorry your ax is lost," said the stranger. "Would you know it if
you were to see it? I found an ax in the road. It may be yours. Is this
it?" he asked, holding out a gold ax.
</P>

<P>
"No," answered the woodman, "that is not my ax. All the money I ever
earned would not buy such an ax as that."
</P>

<P>
"I found another," said the man. "This must be the one," and he held
out a silver ax.
</P>

<P>
"No, that is not mine," replied the woodman. "I am too poor a man to
own such an ax as that."
</P>

<P>
"Well, here is another ax that I found. Is this yours?" The stranger
held out an old ax of steel.
</P>

<P>
"That is mine, oh, that is mine!" cried the woodman, springing up
joyously and taking his ax from the stranger. "Now we shall not starve.
Thank you, kind sir. Where did you find it?"
</P>

<P>
The stranger said, "All three of the axes are yours. I am glad to make
you a present of the gold ax and the silver ax. Let me have your hand.
I am happy to meet an honest man."
</P>

<P>
The woodman's neighbors heard of his good fortune. One of them lost his
ax. He appeared to feel very sad over his loss. He sat down by the
roadside and bowed his head, looking out of the corners of his eyes for
the stranger.
</P>

<P>
At last he saw the stranger coming around a bend in the road. The sun
shown upon a gold ax which he carried in his hand. He stopped in front
of the woodman. "Why do you grieve, my friend?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"I have lost my ax with which I earned my living," the woodman replied.
</P>

<P>
"Cheer up," said the stranger. "I have an ax here. Is it yours?"
</P>

<P>
"That is the very one," said the woodman. "Thank you, stranger," and he
reached out his hand to take the gold ax.
</P>

<P>
But the stranger drew back, and put the ax behind him. "It is not your
ax. It is my own, and you wish to claim it. You are both dishonest and
untruthful;" and he turned away.

THE FOX WITH HIS TAIL CUT OFF
</H3>

<P>
Reynard lost his tail in a trap. Now a fox is proud of two things&mdash;his
cunning and his tail. He had allowed himself to be trapped. This showed
his lack of cunning, and he had lost his tail.
</P>

<P>
He was so ashamed of himself that he could not bear to meet another
fox. He slunk off to his den and came out only when driven by hunger.
When out hunting, he kept out of the way of all his neighbors. He did
not mean that any of them should know of his bad luck.
</P>

<P>
At last he grew tired of living by himself. He wanted to gossip with
his friends.
</P>

<P>
He wondered whether old Rufus was still running on top of the great
meadow fence to throw the hounds off the track.
</P>

<P>
He longed to hear of the latest tricks of Fleetfoot's cubs. They were
three of the brightest little foxes that ever lived. He wished that he
could see them at their play.
</P>

<P>
He wished to know if the men were still cutting down trees near
White-ear's den. If this went on, White-ear would have to find a new
home. It would be hard for her after living in that beautiful spot so
long.
</P>

<P>
If he were to hear the news at all, he must meet his comrades. "How can
I bear to listen to their laugh!" he moaned.
</P>

<P>
He had not lost all of his cunning, as you will see. He lay for a long
time with his head between his paws. His eyes were wide open, but he
was not watching for game. He was thinking.
</P>

<P>
After a while he jumped up. He said to himself:
</P>

<P>
"I shall invite all of my friends to come to my home to-morrow evening.
I shall tell them when they reach here that I can not get up to meet
them for I have been very sick. They will all gather about me here. I
shall sit upon my haunches so that no one will ever find out that my
tail is missing. As they are to be my guests, I must be the spokesman.
My friends have always thought me to be a very fine speaker. Many times
my advice has been asked. I have given it, and it paid my friends to
follow it. The thing which I shall advise to-morrow will surprise them,
but I feel sure that I can get my friends to follow it. I will set to
work now preparing for the feast."
</P>

<P>
Early the next evening Reynard gave a series of strange barks. This was
an invitation to his home. The foxes came from every direction and met
at the foot of an old oak.
</P>

<P>
Reynard's den was under this oak. He sat upon his haunches near the
door to welcome his guests as they came, but he did not move.
</P>

<P>
"You all know, friends, why I do not rise to welcome you," he said. "I
have been very sick, and if I move about it gives me a very bad
headache."
</P>

<P>
Reynard asked his friends, who were standing around him, what they had
been doing for the last week or so. They told many interesting stories
of how they had escaped from traps and dogs and men.
</P>

<P>
A pile of chickens, turkeys, and ducks lay in sight not far away. As
they talked, their eyes often wandered to these.
</P>

<P>
It grew late. The company became a little restless. At last Reynard
said:
</P>

<P>
"Now, friends, before we take our evening meal, I have something to say
for the good of all of us.
</P>

<P>
"I have been lying awake nights thinking what we could do to free
ourselves from the weight of our heavy tails. Spring is here with its
rainy weather. You all know how wet and muddy our tails become. Often I
have had to give up a first-class meal and trot off home, hungry, to
stay until my tail had dried. You have had to do the same. Many a poor
fox has lost his life because of his long tail.
</P>

<P>
"Now, what do you say to having our tails cut off? Think what free
lives we shall then lead. I will cut them off if you wish. The cutting
will be almost painless, I am sure. Now let us have them off in a hurry
before supper. After our feast, we shall have a great dance."
</P>

<P>
His visitors were silent for a moment. Some nodded their heads, showing
that they were ready to part with their tails.
</P>

<P>
The oldest and wisest fox in the crowd had been looking at Reynard very
closely. He was the only one of all that crowd to miss Reynard's tail.
At last he spoke slowly:
</P>

<P>
"Your advice may be good, but before I reply, pray turn yourself
around."
</P>

<P>
Poor Reynard saw that he was found out. He dared not refuse to do as he
was told, so he turned about.
</P>

<P>
What a shout the foxes gave! Poor bobtail could not say a word. The
foxes seized the turkeys, ducks, and chickens, and ran off home with
their long tails behind them, and poor Reynard was never again seen by
any of them.

<P>
The peacock received both of them very kindly in his arbor.
</P>

<P>
"I have long wished to meet you," said the blackbird. "Many have told
me of your beauty and of your grace. I find that they did not tell me
half." He stroked the peacock's coat lovingly as he praised him.
</P>

<P>
The dove was silent.
</P>

<P>
At last they bade the peacock good-by, the blackbird making many low
bows.
</P>

<P>
As they started home, the blackbird said, "I hope I may never meet that
stupid peacock again. I can not bear him. Did you notice his feet? I
felt like laughing every time I looked at them. His voice makes me
shudder. What can anyone see to praise in that bird?"
</P>

<P>
"I did not notice his feet nor his voice," said the dove. "He has a
noble form and his dress is very beautiful. The rainbow and the flowers
are not more beautiful."
</P>

The blackbird turned away in shame. He wished to hear fault found with
the peacock, but the dove gave only the highest praise.

He stopped suddenly and looked down into the water. There was his
shadow. "That dog has a larger piece of meat than I," he said. "I want

<P>
He growled, but the dog in the water did not move nor did he drop his

He snapped at the dog in the water. He was soon sorry for that, for the

Each day the goose laid a gold egg. The farmer had a dozen.

"I shall soon be a rich man," he said, "but I do wish the goose would

After the goose had laid many eggs, the farmer said, "That goose has

"How I hate this early rising!" said a donkey, with a great yawn. "I
wish I might sleep till sunrise. Here I am, harnessed and ready to
start to town before the roosters crow. And why? To take a little fruit
and a few vegetables to market. Isn't that a foolish reason for
spoiling my dreams!"
</P>

<P>
The master was tired of his donkey, for he never seemed willing to do
his work. "I do hate a donkey with his ears turned backward," he said.
"He has no right to complain, for his work is really light, and he gets
plenty of food and rest."
</P>

<P>
One day a tanner came along. He saw what a strong donkey the gardener
drove, and asked his price. The gardener was glad to sell him. "I hope
he will enjoy his new work," said the gardener. "He never seemed quite
happy with me."
</P>

<P>
The tanner used the donkey to carry hides. These were heavy and
bad-smelling. They almost made him sick.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, dear!" the donkey groaned one day. "I wish I were back with the
gardener. The vegetables were fresh and I was often given a cabbage
leaf or a beet top. I did have to get out early, to be sure, but I did
not work late. Here I must work early and late, and if I turn out of
the road to get a mouthful of grass, I am beaten soundly. I hate this
work and this place."
</P>

<P>
The donkey was so ill-natured that the tanner sold him to a coal miner.
He was lowered into a coal mine, where he had to pass his time pulling
loads of coal. The mine was dark, and he was kept very busy.

"This is very bad," he cried. "I wish I were with the gardener, or even

hole in the ground." But there he ended his unhappy life.

THE COBBLER AND THE RICH MAN
</H3>

<P>
A cobbler worked in his shop from morning until night, and as he worked
he sang. Tired people who heard him were rested, and sad men and women
were cheered as they came near the shop. Children visited him and
watched him at his work and heard him sing. They called him "Jolly
Gregory."
</P>

<P>
"How can he sing when he works so hard and makes so little?" many
asked; but still his singing went on.
</P>

<P>
Across the road from the cobbler lived a rich man. His home was
beautiful, his clothes fine, and his fare the best that money could
buy; but never in his life had he been known to give to anyone who
needed help. He was really poor, for he lacked one thing which he very
much wanted&mdash;sleep. Sometimes he could not get to sleep until early
morning; then his neighbor's song would waken him. He wished that sleep
could be bought for money.
</P>

<P>
One day he said to himself, "I believe I will help that cobbler over
the way. He has a hard time to make enough money to buy his food and
clothes." So he sent for the cobbler.
</P>

<P>
"Honest Gregory," he said "how much do you earn in a year?"
</P>

<P>
"How much a year?" replied the cobbler, scratching his head. "I never
reckon my money in that way. It goes as fast as it comes, but I am glad
to be able to earn it. I cobble on from day to day and earn a living."
</P>

<P>
"Well then, Gregory, how much do you earn each day?" asked the rich man.
</P>

<P>
"Why, sometimes more and sometimes less," answered the cobbler. "On
many days&mdash;the holidays&mdash;I earn nothing. I wish there were fewer of
these; but then we manage to live."
</P>

<P>
"You are a happy man now," said the rich man, "but I will make you
happier," and he handed the cobbler five hundred dollars. "Go spend
this money carefully. It will supply your needs for many days," he said.
</P>

<P>
The cobbler had never dreamed of so much money before. He thought it
was enough to keep him in food and clothes all his life.
</P>

<P>
He took the money home and hid it, but he hid his joy with it. He
stopped singing and became sad. He could not sleep for fear of robbers.
He thought that everyone who came into his shop was trying to find out
his secret, or wished a gift. When a cat ran over the floor, he thought
a thief had slipped through the door.
</P>

<P>
At last, poor man, he could bear it no longer. He took the money,
hurried to the rich man, and cried, "Oh, give me back my songs and my
sweet sleep! Here is your money, every cent of it. I made a poor trade."
</P>

<P>
The rich man looked at him and said, "I thought I had made you happy. I
have not missed your songs, for, strange as it may seem, I have been
sleeping soundly ever since I talked with you."

THE ICE KING
</H3>

<P>
A tribe of Indians lived near a river. One winter the weather was very
cold, and many of them died.
</P>

<P>
But spring came at last. The snow melted from the tops of the mountains
and ran in torrents down their steep sides and into the river.
</P>

<P>
The ice in the swollen river broke up into large cakes which floated
down the stream.
</P>

<P>
The weather grew warmer. All the ice melted except one big cake which
the flood had left on the bank of the river.
</P>

<P>
The sun had been shining on this piece of ice for many days, but it
would not melt. There were signs of spring everywhere except in this
one spot.
</P>

<P>
A brave warrior had been watching this piece of ice. He said to
himself, "That is the Ice King, I am sure. I must conquer him."
</P>

<P>
He raised his big war club and struck the Ice King, crying, "Come on,
Ice King! Do your best. Freeze me if you can. I will show you that I am
as strong as you are."
</P>

<P>
He struck again and again, and the Ice King began to shrink. Pieces of
ice floated down the river. At last he became so small that the Indian
picked him up and tossed him into the river.
</P>

<P>
"There!" cried the Indian, "off with you! Never dare to come back here
again."
</P>

<P>
The Ice King whirled about and screamed, "I go now, but I shall come
again. Look for me next winter. I will show you then which of us is the
stronger."
</P>

<P>
The Indian hunted and fished all summer, but when autumn was near he
began to think of the threat of the Ice King. "He will keep his word,"
said the Indian, "and I must get ready to fight him."
</P>

<P>
The Indian placed his wigwam among the trees, where it was well
sheltered from the winds. Near it he heaped up a large pile of dry
wood. Then he caught some large fish and tried out their fat so that he
might have plenty of oil. He made thick clothes for himself out of the
skins of animals. During the summer he had gathered much wild rice, and
now he dried meat. While he was getting ready, the weather was becoming
colder.
</P>

<P>
At last all was done, and the Indian said, as he sat by his blazing
fire, "Let the Ice King come. I am ready for him."
</P>

<P>
That night the Ice King froze the little pools of water. After a few
days the lakes and rivers were frozen. It was very cold.
</P>

<P>
One night when the Indian was sitting by his fire, the Ice King stepped
to the door of the wigwam. He walked boldly to the fire and sat down
opposite the Indian.
</P>

<P>
How cold the Ice King's breath felt! It nearly put out the fire. The
poor Indian shivered, but he said to himself, "The Ice King shall not
conquer me." He jumped up and threw dry wood on the fire. Then he
poured oil upon the wood. The fire blazed up. The Indian put on more
wood and more oil. The fire roared and crackled.
</P>

<P>
The Ice King began to feel too warm. He moved back a little way. The
fire became hotter. The Ice King moved farther back. He began to sweat
and to grow smaller and weaker. Then he cried out, "My friend, I am
conquered. Let me go! Oh, let me go!"
</P>

<P>
The Indian arose and pushed the fire back from the Ice King. Then he
took his trembling hand, lifted him up, and led him to the door of the
wigwam.
</P>

<P>
As the Ice King passed out he said, "You have conquered me twice. You
shall always be my master."
</P>

<P>
Ever since that time men have been masters of the Ice King. When his
cold breath blows, they make the fires warmer and their clothing
thicker.

THE WOLF, THE GOAT, AND THE KID
</H3>

<P>
"Good-by, little one," said Mrs. White Paw, the goat, to her daughter.
</P>

<P>
"Do not go, mother, I am afraid to stay here alone," cried little Nanny.
</P>

<P>
"But I must get my dinner or you will have no milk for your supper,"
said her mother.
</P>

<P>
"There is nothing to fear but the prowling wolf. Bar the door when I am
gone; then he can not get in. Do not open the door unless you hear this
password, 'Cursed be the wolf and all his race!'"
</P>

<P>
The mother, as she trotted away, felt no fear for her little daughter's
safety. "No one knows that password but myself," she said; "but I shall
be very glad when Nanny is old enough to go out with me to dine on the
green hill. She is lonely when I am gone."
</P>

<P>
Little Nanny was not as safe as the mother thought, for slinking in the
bushes near Mrs. White Paw's home was the hateful wolf. He heard the
password which the mother gave to her little one, and laughed at the
thought of the good feast which he should have by and by.
</P>

<P>
After the mother had been away for some time, the wolf sneaked to the
door of the little house. He knocked, and gave the password, "Cursed be
the wolf and all his race." in a voice much like that of Mrs. White Paw.
</P>

<P>
Nanny started to open the door, thinking that her mother had come home;
but she stopped, for the voice had not sounded quite like her mother's
voice. "I will make sure that it is no one but my mother," she said to
herself. So she called, "Mother, show me your white paw before I open
the door."
</P>

<P>
The wolf was angry, for he had no white paw to show. He gave a long,
angry howl and went away.
</P>

<P>
The mother heard the howl as she turned her face homeward. "That will
frighten Nanny," she said, and she hurried home. On reaching the house,
she knocked and called in a cheery voice, "Cursed be the wolf and all
his race."
</P>

<P>
Nanny did not open the door at once. She called back, "Show me your
white paw, mother."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. White Paw put her paw to the crack in the door, and the door flew
open.
</P>

<P>
"Why did you not let me in as soon as I gave the password, Nanny?"
asked her mother.
</P>

<P>
Nanny told her of the wolf's visit. Mrs. White Paw was very proud of
her wise daughter.
</P>

<P>
"Now have your supper, my brave Nanny, and go to bed. How glad I am
that you are safe!" said the happy mother.

THE WISE GOAT
</H3>

<P>
A goat was on top of a high cliff eating grass.
</P>

<P>
A wolf was at the foot of the cliff looking at him. He wanted the goat
for his supper, but he could not climb the steep cliff.
</P>

<P>
"Come down here," said the wolf. "The grass is much better here. See
how much of it there is."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you," said the goat. "You may have all of that good grass
yourself, but you shall not eat me."

THE SHEPHERD AND THE DOGS
</H3>

<P>
"Hero is a wonderful dog," said a shepherd, "I have not lost a sheep
since I owned him, not one. Some foolish wolves tried to kill him when
he was a puppy, but he treated them so badly that they have since been
careful to keep out of his way."
</P>

<P>
"He is certainly a brave dog," said a neighbor, "but I think you are
foolish to keep him. He eats as much meat as a dozen small dogs, and
smaller dogs would take as good care of your sheep as he."
</P>

<P>
"There may be something in what you say," said the shepherd. "I have
often wished that Hero ate less meat, but I should hate to part from
him."
</P>

<P>
The next day the mayor of the town rode by. "What will you take for
that dog of yours?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"I can not spare him," said the shepherd; "he is too good a friend to
part from. His only fault is a liking for meat."
</P>

<P>
"I will give you a hundred dollars for him," said the mayor, "and he
shall have all the meat he cares to eat."
</P>

<P>
"You will not be foolish enough to refuse that offer, I hope," said the
neighbor. "Think how much meat you will save."
</P>

<P>
"I think I shall have to let him go," replied the shepherd, slowly and
sadly.
</P>

<P>
That night Hero was taken to the mayor's house and the shepherd
received his money.
</P>

<P>
The shepherd found three curs in town to take Hero's place. He paid
nothing for them, for their owners were very glad to get rid of them.
</P>

<P>
The next day the wolves said, "Hero is gone! Hero is gone! Now for a
feast. We do not care for those cowardly dogs."
</P>

<P>
When the new dogs saw the wolves coming, they cried out, "Let us run,"
and away they all went.
</P>

<P>
When the sheep saw the wolves, they too began to run.
</P>

<P>
The shepherd was taking care of a lame lamb in a distant part of the
field. When he saw the wolves chasing his sheep, he ran toward them;
but before he could frighten the wolves away, they had killed several
sheep.
</P>

<P>
"What a fool I have been," said the shepherd, "to let my neighbor do my
thinking for me!"

THE BOY AND THE NUTS
</H3>

<P>
A glass jar half full of nuts stood on a table.
</P>

<P>
Albert, who was very fond of nuts, saw it. He climbed up on the table
and thrust his hand into the jar, grasping a whole handful. He tried to
pull his hand out. The mouth of the jar was too narrow for his fist.
</P>

<P>
He pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar, but it was of no
use.
</P>

<P>
At last he began to scream and cry. His mother hurried into the room to
find out what was the matter with him.
</P>

<P>
"What hurts you, Albert?" she asked.
</P>

<P>
"This old jar will not let me have this handful of nuts," cried Albert.
</P>

<P>
His mother laughed when she saw the cause of all his trouble.
</P>

<P>
"Do you wish so many nuts?" she asked. "Try taking out a few at a time."
</P>

<P>
Albert did as his mother told him to do, and found that he could easily
get the nuts.
</P>

<P>
"When you get into trouble again, my son, stop and think of a way out,
instead of screaming," said his mother.

THE CROW AND THE PITCHER
</H3>

<P>
No rain had fallen for many weeks. All the small streams and the ponds
were dried up.
</P>

<P>
An old crow had been looking for water all the morning. At last he
found some in a pitcher in a garden. He flew down to it and thrust in
his bill; but he could not reach the water.
</P>

<P>
He walked around to the other side and tried again; but he could not
get a drink. Oh, how very thirsty he was! It seemed as if he should
faint.
</P>

<P>
"I must have that water. I will have it," he said.
</P>

<P>
Again he stretched his neck into the pitcher. No, he could not reach it.
</P>

<P>
He stopped a second and seemed to be thinking; then he said, "I will
break the pitcher. My bill is strong and hard." So he gave the pitcher
a hard thump. It did not break. He "thumped! thumped! thumped!" first
here, then there. What a strong pitcher that was! It did not even crack.
</P>

<P>
"This will not do," he said. "I must try some other plan. I am big and
strong. I will tip the pitcher over."
</P>

<P>
With that he pushed against it with his breast. It did not move. It
seemed as if he must give up the attempt to get the water, but he did
not once think of doing that.
</P>

<P>
Near by in the path lay some pebbles. The crow picked up one in his
bill and let it fall into the pitcher. He dropped one after another
into it. He could see the water rising a little. Now he worked harder
than ever.
</P>

<P>
Before very long the water had risen so high that he could reach it
with his bill. How refreshing it was! He drank as much as he wished,
then flew away.

THE GROCER AND HIS DONKEY
</H3>

<P>
A grocer went to a city not far away to get some salt. He took his
donkey along to carry the load. On their way they had to cross a little
stream over which there was only a narrow footbridge.
</P>

<P>
When they reached the city, the grocer placed some heavy sacks of salt
upon the donkey's back and they started homeward.
</P>

<P>
On reaching the middle of the stream, the donkey stumbled and fell. As
he arose, the water dripped down his sides and he noticed that his load
had become much lighter.
</P>

<P>
The grocer had lost so much salt that it was necessary for him to
return to the city and get a fresh supply. This time he put on a
heavier load than at first.
</P>

<P>
When they reached the stream, the donkey said to himself, "This is a
very heavy load that I am carrying, but I know how to make it lighter,"
and he lay down in the stream. When he arose, his load was much
lighter, as he had expected.
</P>

<P>
"I will break him of that trick," said the grocer.
</P>

<P>
He drove the donkey to the city again, and heaped great bags of sponges
upon his back.
</P>

<P>
The load was not very heavy, but the donkey said to himself, "I will
make it still lighter."
</P>

<P>
When he came to the stream, he lay down again in the water. He started
to rise, but to his surprise he could hardly get up.
</P>

<P>
"What can be the matter?" he thought.
</P>

<P>
His master, laughing, said, "Have you learned your lesson, old fellow?
We shall see."
</P>

<P>
He drove the groaning donkey slowly back to the city, took the sponges
from his back, and loaded him again with salt.
</P>

<P>
When the donkey came again to the stream, he picked his way carefully,
for he did not wish to fall. This time he got across safely, and the
grocer arrived at home with his entire load of salt.

THE THREE FISH
</H3>

<P>
Three large fish lived very happily in a pond which few people ever
passed.
</P>

<P>
One of these fish was always wise, the second was wise sometimes, but
the third was never wise.
</P>

<P>
One day two men who were passing by the pond saw the fish.
</P>

<P>
One of them said, "Let us hurry home and get our nets. Those fish are
too fine to lose." So they hurried away.
</P>

<P>
The three fish were very much frightened. The first one thought a
moment, then swam through the outlet of the pond into the river.
</P>

<P>
When the men came back with their nets, there were only two fish to be
seen. They found the outlet of the pond and made a dam across it.
</P>

<P>
The second fish now began to think; he came to the top of the water and
floated on his back. One of the men picked him up in his net, but he
seemed dead, so he threw him back into the water.
</P>

<P>
The fish that never thought sank to the bottom of the pond and was
easily caught.

THE WAGONER
</H3>

<P>
"We must have coal," said the farmers to the wagoner.
</P>

<P>
"But the roads are very bad," replied the wagoner. "I never saw them
worse."
</P>

<P>
"We can not wait for the roads to dry," said the farmers, "for without
a fire we should take cold. Besides, we should have to eat uncooked
food."
</P>

<P>
So the wagoner went into the country with a load of coal. He had not
gone far when his wagon stuck fast in the mud.
</P>

<P>
"What am I to do now?" he asked himself. "I ought to have known better
than to start out."
</P>

<P>
"Get up!" he cried to his horses. "Get up there, you lazy brutes! Pull
out of here!"
</P>

<P>
The horses struggled hard, but they could not start the load.
</P>

<P>
"Hey there!" he called to a man who was working in a field near by.
"Come and help us out of this mud-hole."
</P>

<P>
The man in the field had been watching the poor horses as they pulled
with all their strength. He was angry at the wagoner for beating them
so cruelly.
</P>

<P>
"Put your shoulder to the wheel," he called back. "When you have done
all you can to help yourself, I shall be willing to help you."
</P>

<P>
The wagoner climbed down, muttering to himself, "I don't want to get
down into this mud."
</P>

<P>
He put his shoulder to the wheel, pushed long and steadily while the
horses pulled. Slowly the load began to move. Before long it was on
firm ground.
</P>

<P>
The wagoner climbed up to his seat and called back to the man who was
working in the field, "My load is out, but no thanks to you."

The man replied, "You took my advice and put your shoulder to the
wheel; that is what brought you out."

THE LARK AND THE FARMER
</H3>

<P>
A meadow lark built her nest in a field of wheat. She had a happy time
raising her family, for no one came near her nest.
</P>

<P>
There were four little larks in her family, and they were now nearly
large enough to fly.
</P>

<P>
The wheat was ripe and the mother knew that men might come to the field
any day to reap; so she said to her little ones, "I am going out to get
your breakfast. You must keep your ears and eyes wide open while I am
gone; if you see or hear anything strange, you must tell me about it
when I come back."
</P>

<P>
"All right, mother," said the young larks, "we shall do as you tell us."
</P>

<P>
The mother had been gone but a few minutes when the farmer who owned
the field and his son came out to look at the wheat.
</P>

<P>
"This grain is ready to cut," said the farmer to his son. "This evening
go to our neighbor, Mr. White, and ask him to cut it for us to-morrow."
</P>

<P>
The little larks were much frightened. They could hardly wait for their
mother to get home.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, mother!" they called out as soon as they saw her; "do take us away
from this field. The farmer has sent for Mr. White to cut this wheat
to-morrow."
</P>

<P>
"If that is so," said the mother, "you need have no fear. If he waits
for his neighbor to do his work, his wheat will not be cut."
</P>

<P>
Late the next afternoon while the mother lark was away, the farmer and
his son came to the field again.
</P>

<P>
"Did you ask Mr. White to reap the grain?" said the farmer.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," replied his son, "and he promised to come."
</P>

<P>
"But he has not come," said the farmer, "and it is so late that I know
he will not come to-day. The wheat will spoil if it is not cut. If our
neighbors will not help us, we shall have to call upon our relatives.
Go out this afternoon and ask your uncle John and his sons to cut the
wheat for us to-morrow."
</P>

<P>
As soon as the mother came home, the little birds said, "The wheat will
surely be cut tomorrow, for the farmer has sent for his relatives to
cut it. Please take us away to-night, mother."
</P>

<P>
"Don't worry," said the mother; "there is no danger so long as the
farmer waits for his relatives to do the work. We will stay right here
to-night."
</P>

<P>
About noon the next day, the farmer and his son came to the field
again. "This grain is still standing," said the father. "I told you to
get your uncle John and his sons to cut it today. Why has nothing been
done?"
</P>

<P>
"I called upon them and asked them to cut the wheat. They said that
they would be here this morning. I do not know why they did not come."
</P>

<P>
"This grain must not stand another day," said the farmer. "It is
shelling out now. You and I will come out here early to-morrow and cut
it ourselves."
</P>

<P>
When the mother lark heard that the farmer had made up his mind to cut
the wheat himself, she said to her little ones, "Get ready to fly away.
If the farmer is to do the work himself, it will be done at once."

A lion was sleeping one day when a little mouse came along and ran up

</P>

<P>
This awakened the lion and made him very angry.
</P>

<P>
He put his paw over the mouse and said, "What do you mean by waking me?
You shall pay for this," and he opened his big mouth to swallow the
mouse.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, do not kill me, Mr. Lion!" squealed the mouse. "I did not mean to
waken you. Do let me go and I will never trouble you again."
</P>

<P>
"No, I will not let you go," roared the lion.
</P>

<P>
"Please do," cried the frightened mouse. "If you will let me go perhaps
I can do something for you sometime."
</P>

<P>
This made the lion laugh. "You do something for ME," he said. "What a
joke! Well, you are such a little fellow that I will let you go this
time, but never let me see you about here again," and he lifted his paw.
</P>

<P>
As the little mouse scampered off, he said, "Thank you, kind lion, I
shall not forget your kindness."
</P>

<P>
Some time after this the lion was caught in a trap. The hunters tied
him to a tree while they went to get a wagon to carry him away.

The lion roared so loud that the ground shook. The little mouse heard
him.
</P>

<P>
"That lion is in trouble," he said. "I will see what I can do to help
him," and he ran to the lion.
</P>

<P>
When the mouse saw that the lion was tied with ropes, he said, "Cheer
up, Mr. Lion. Be quiet and I will set you free," and he began gnawing
the ropes.

"I shall drown!" he cried. "Help! help! help!" but his voice was so
tiny that it could not be heard.

A dove was sitting in a tree that overhung the water. She saw the ant
struggling, and quickly nipped off a leaf and let it fall into the

leaf was washed upon the bank of the stream.

The ant called out in its tiny voice, "Thank you, kind dove, you have
saved my life;" but of course the dove could not hear him.

Several days after this, the dove was again sitting in a tree. A hunter
crept carefully up to the tree. His gun was pointed at the dove and he

THE HAPPY FAMILY
</H3>

<P>
There was once a very queer family living in the woods. There were four
in all&mdash;a rat, a raven, a tortoise, and a gazelle.
</P>

<P>
All day the animals were away from home hunting food.
</P>

<P>
The rat caught beetles which had hidden under leaves. He visited fields
and barns Now and then he went to a henhouse.
</P>

<P>
The tortoise found plenty of insects in the woods and fields and did
not object to a toadstool now and then.
</P>

<P>
The raven visited grain fields where he often met the rat.
</P>

<P>
The gazelle ate grass wherever he could find it. When he could not get
grass, he ate the sprouts of trees.
</P>

<P>
At night all met at their home in the woods and talked of what had
happened to them through the day. This is one of their adventures:
</P>

<P>
One day when the gazelle was out feeding, a hound scented his tracks
and followed him. The gazelle heard the hound bark and darted off like
the wind. The hound followed until worn out with running; then he gave
up the chase. The gazelle stopped to eat grass. He was hungry and a
long way from home.
</P>

<P>
That evening when the animals returned home they missed the gazelle.
</P>

<P>
The raven asked, "How does it happen that the gazelle is not home? Is
he tired of us already?"
</P>

<P>
"No, indeed," said the rat. "I am sure that he is not. If I were a bird
I should fly away at once to find him. I know that he would be here if
he could get here."
</P>

<P>
"I will see if I can find him," said the raven, and he flew away. After
a while he spied the gazelle, who had been caught in a net. He was
trying hard to free himself, but the ropes that bound him were too
strong for him to break. The raven flew back home to get the help of
the rat.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, rat," he said, "follow me. Our friend, the gazelle, is caught in a
net. Come and gnaw the ropes and set him free!"
</P>

<P>
The raven flew away and the rat followed. As the rat left home, he
said, "Tortoise, you had better stay at home. You go so slowly that you
can not reach the gazelle in time to help. We shall soon be back, I
hope."
</P>

<P>
As soon as the raven and the rat were out of sight, the tortoise said,
"I can not stay here and do nothing. I may be needed. I will hurry as
fast as I can;" and he started off.
</P>

<P>
The raven reached the gazelle first. He said, "Cheer up, the rat is
coming to set you free."
</P>

<P>
Soon the rat arrived. He began at once to gnaw the ropes. He had just
set the gazelle free when a hunter came along. The gazelle sprang to
one side into the bushes, the raven flew into a tree, and the rat ran
into a hole in the ground.
</P>

<P>
The hunter looked about for the gazelle, but could not find him. He was
very angry.
</P>

<P>
Just then the tortoise came up. The hunter picked him up and put him
into his bag for his supper.
</P>

<P>
The raven whispered to the gazelle, "The hunter is carrying off our
tortoise."
</P>

<P>
As soon as the gazelle heard this, he came out of his hiding place and
limped along as if he were lame.
</P>

<P>
The hunter saw him. He threw down his bag and ran after the gazelle,
thinking that he could easily catch him; but the gazelle kept ahead of
him. At last the hunter could run no more. He went back to get his bag,
tired and cross, but sure of a supper.
</P>

<P>
But what do you suppose had happened while he was gone? The rat had
gnawed a hole in the hunter's bag and set the tortoise free, and both
had run off.
</P>

<P>
It was now quite dark, and all the animals went home. That was the
happiest evening of their lives. Each one had done something for the
others, and all were safe, and it was good to be at home.

THE TYRANT WHO BECAME A JUST RULER
</H3>

<P>
There was once a king who was so cruel to his people that he was called
"The Tyrant."
</P>

<P>
The people used to wish that he would die so that they might have a
better king.
</P>

<P>
One day he called his people together. They feared to go to him, yet
they did not dare to stay away. When they were all standing before him,
he arose and said:
</P>

<P>
"My dear people, I have been very unkind to you, but I hope after this
to make your lives peaceful and happy."
</P>

<P>
The king kept his word. He sent good men to all parts of his kingdom to
find out what the people most needed to make them happy. He then had
everything done for them that a just king could do. He helped them to
build good roads and bridges. He made their taxes lighter. He gave them
a holiday now and then. The people learned to trust him and to love him.
</P>

<P>
One day one of his subjects said to him, "Please, O king, tell me why
you are so much better to us now than you used to be."
</P>

<P>
The king replied:
</P>

<P>
"As I was going through a forest one afternoon I saw a hound chasing a
fox. He caught the fox and bit him badly. The fox will always be lame.
</P>

<P>
"When the hound was going home, a man threw a stone at him and broke
his leg.
</P>

<P>
"The man had not gone far when his horse threw him and his leg was
broken.
</P>

<P>
"The horse started to run, but he stepped into a hole and broke his leg.
</P>

<P>
"I sat down by the road and thought about what I had seen. I said to
myself, 'He who does wrong to any living thing will suffer for it
sooner or later,' and that is why I am a better king and a happier
man."

THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE
</H3>

<P>
"Why do you move along so slowly?" said a hare to a tortoise. "Let me
show you how to get over the ground."
</P>

<P>
"You think I am slow, do you?" replied the tortoise. "Let us run a race
to the cross-roads. I think I can beat you."
</P>

<P>
"Do you hear that?" said the hare to a fox, who was standing near.
"Could anyone even think that such a slow-coach could beat me in a
race?"
</P>

<P>
"It would be a good joke if he did," said the fox. "Do you wish to run
a race? I will be the judge, if you care to have me."
</P>

<P>
"That suits me well," answered the hare.
</P>

<P>
"I am willing," said the tortoise.
</P>

<P>
So the fox marked off a place for starting, and set up a stake at the
goal.
</P>

<P>
The hare and the tortoise stood side by side, and at the command,
"Go!", from the fox, they began the race.
</P>

<P>
The hare bounded along and was very soon far ahead of the tortoise. He
called back to the fox, "I think I shall take a little nap before I
finish the race; the tortoise will not reach here for an hour or more."
So he lay down in some bushes and went to sleep.
</P>

<P>
Every minute brought the tortoise a little nearer to the goal. He did
not stop for a second.
</P>

<P>
At last he passed the hare, but the hare still slept. On and on he
plodded; it was a long way, but he had no thought of stopping.
</P>

<P>
He came nearer and nearer the goal. At last his foot touched the stake.
</P>

<P>
The hare wakened, stretched himself, and leaped toward the goal. "What,
you here!" he cried when he saw the tortoise. "How did you ever reach
here?"
</P>

<P>
"Just by keeping at it," said the tortoise.

THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR DONKEY
</H3>

<P>
"I shall have to sell that donkey of ours," said a miller to his son.
"I can not afford to keep him through the winter. I will take him to
town this very morning to see if I can find a buyer. You may go with
me." In a little while the miller, his son, and the donkey were on
their way to town.
</P>

<P>
They had not gone far when they met some girls going to a party. They
were talking and laughing as they went along. One of them said, "Look
at that man and boy driving a donkey. One of them surely might ride."
</P>

<P>
The miller heard what they said, and quickly made his you mount the
donkey, while he walked along at its side.
</P>

<P>
After a while they came to a group of old men who were talking very
earnestly. "There," said one, "I was just saying that boys and girls
have no respect for the aged. You see it is true in this case. See that
boy riding while his old father has to walk."
</P>

<P>
"Get down, my son," said his father, "and I will ride." So they went on.
</P>

<P>
They next met some women coming from town. "Why!" they cried, "your
poor little boy is nearly tired out. How can you ride and make him
walk?" So the miller made his son ride on the donkey behind him.
</P>

<P>
They were now in town. A man coming down the street called to the
miller, "Why do you make your donkey carry such a load? You can carry
him better than he can carry you."
</P>

<P>
At this the miller and his son got off the donkey. They tied the
donkey's legs together, turned him over on his back; and began to carry
him.
</P>

<P>
A crowd soon gathered to see the strange sight. As they were crossing a
bridge the donkey became frightened at the hooting of the crowd. He
broke loose, fell into the river, and was drowned.
</P>

<P>
The miller was angry and ashamed. He said, "There! I have tried to
please everybody and have only made a fool of myself. After this I
shall do as I think best and let people say what they will."

THE PUG DOG AND HIS SHADOW
</H3>

<P>
"I am going out to see the world," said a pug puppy.
</P>

<P>
He ran down a hill as fast as his wabbly legs could carry him, and
looked into a little brook which flowed by.
</P>

<P>
"How queer!" he said, "I did not know that puppies live in water. This
one looks just like my brothers, but it can not be one of them. They
were all asleep when I came away. I will run home to tell mother about
it," and up the hill he went as fast as he could carry his fat little
body.
</P>

<P>
When he arrived at home, he panted out, "Oh, mother! I have found out
something that you do not know. There is a pug puppy living in the
creek."
</P>

<P>
"You are either dreaming, my son, or you have seen your own shadow,"
said his mother.
</P>

<P>
"I know what I saw, mother. I am not dreaming. It was not my shadow. It
was a puppy dog," and the little pug barked savagely at his mother.
"Come with me, mother. I will show you that I know what I am talking
about." So the mother followed her puppy.
</P>

<P>
When they came near the foot of the hill, the little pug ran on ahead
of his mother and looked into the stream.
</P>

<P>
"How lucky!" he said, "he is still here. Now, mother, you see that what
I said is true."
</P>

<P>
"It is your shadow, little one."
</P>

<P>
"No, no, my eyes are better than yours, mother."
</P>

<P>
Just then his mother came up and stood beside him.
</P>

<P>
"How queer!" said the little dog. "That is the pug's mother. I did not
see her before. It would be too cold for me down in that water. Why do
they live there?"
</P>

<P>
"You foolish child," replied the mother. "It is our shadows that you
see there. See, they are just like us."
</P>

<P>
"I am not a baby. I know what dogs are, mother. Those are real dogs."
</P>

<P>
"Watch, my son, and see what happens," and the mother dropped a stone
on the two shadows. They were gone.
</P>

<P>
The little pug stood surprised. He dropped his ears and went slowly
home without saying another word.

THE PARTRIDGE IN THE NET
</H3>

<P>
"I have caught one at last," said a hunter, "and this is as fine a
partridge as one often sees. It is a young one, too, I do believe," and
he reached his hand into the net to take it out.
</P>

<P>
This frightened the partridge. It fluttered and cackled, pecking at the
hunter's hand.
</P>

<P>
At last it cried out, "Let me go! Do let me go! I am but one little
bird. If you will set me free, I will lead a large flock of partridges
to your net, and will coax them to go into it."
</P>

<P>
But the hunter said, "You seem very willing to deceive the partridges;
you might also deceive me. I will not let you go."

THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN
</H3>

<P>
"I am stronger than you," said the North Wind to the Sun.
</P>

<P>
"That is not true," said the Sun. "Everyone knows that I am the
stronger."
</P>

<P>
"Show me that you are stronger than I," replied the North Wind. "You
know very well that you are not."
</P>

<P>
"Do you see that traveler coming? I can make him take off his coat. You
can not," said the Sun.
</P>

<P>
"We will see about that," answered the North Wind. "The one that makes
the traveler take off his coat is the victor."
</P>

<P>
"All right," said the Sun, "and you may have the first trial."
</P>

<P>
"Whew! How the North Wind blows," said the traveler. "Whew! whew! Hold
on there, North Wind; I would rather walk than fly. Whew! whew!
</P>

<P>
"How cold it is! I must button my coat uptight. Whew! whew! whew! I
never felt such a wind before," said the traveler, as he folded his
arms over his breast. "It seems determined to tear off my coat. I will
turn my back to it. Whew! whew! whew! whew!" But the more the wind
blew, the tighter the traveler held on to his coat.
</P>

<P>
At last the North Wind said, "I will try no longer, but you, Sun, can
do no better."
</P>

<P>
The Sun said nothing, but came out from under a cloud and smiled down
upon the traveler.
</P>

<P>
"How good that feels!" said the traveler. The Sun shone on. "It is
getting warm," said the traveler, unbuttoning his coat.
</P>

<P>
It was now past noon. "The Sun is too much for me," said the traveler,
and he threw off his coat and hunted for a shady place.

THE CAMEL AND HIS MASTER
</H3>

<P>
One night a camel looked into the tent where his master was sleeping.
"How warm it is in there!" he said. "I should like a good place like
that myself."
</P>

<P>
The next night he put his head inside the door. "You will not mind my
putting my head into the tent, I am sure," said he to his master. "The
wind is cold to-night."
</P>

<P>
"Not at all," replied his master; "there is plenty of room."
</P>

<P>
In a little while the camel said, "Kind master, my neck is very cold;
would you mind if I put it inside the tent?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no," said his master.
</P>

<P>
Now the camel seemed satisfied. But in a little while he wakened his
master, saying, "My forelegs are getting cold. I should like to have
them under cover."
</P>

<P>
His master moved over a little and said, "You may have a little more
room. I know it is a cold night." So the camel moved a little farther
into the tent.
</P>

<P>
Very soon the camel wakened his master again, saying, "I keep the tent
door open by standing in the door. That makes it cold for both of us.
Had I not better come wholly in?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, come in," said the master. "There is hardly room for both of us,
but I do not want you to suffer from the cold," So the camel crowded
into the tent.
</P>

<P>
As soon as he was inside, he said: "Yes, I see there is not room for
both of us inside the tent. If you were to go out, I should have a
chance to lie down. So go!" And he pushed his master out of the tent.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
